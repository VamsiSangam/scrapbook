# Scrapbook
Are you new to GitHub and want to experiment some features of GitHub but don't know where to start? Well, start right here! Scrapbook is a repository where you are free to do whatever you like.

### GitHub Work Flow

Before you try out anything crazy, firstly you must try out the basic GitHub work flow -

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch in your forked copy.
3. Make some changes in your new branch.
4. Create a pull request to merge your changes.

This 4-step process is how anybody would contribute to any project in GitHub.

### Now for some crazy stuff
Now that you know how to contribute to a GitHub project, here are a few things you could try out -
1. Add a HTML page about yourself.
2. Create a new issue in this repository.
3. Try to contribute to another branch other than the master branch.
4. Review someone else's pull request.
5. Syncing your fork after somebody has made changes to this repository.
6. Purposefully create a pull request which will conflict with the existing code and then correct it later.
7. Creating wiki pages for this repo. Please create some wiki content about Git or GitHub basics.
8. Create a list of emoji's available in GitHub.

Happy Coding!
